This directory should contain subdirectories for test cases for the 
chem package. This should be tested when ever changes are made, and
***ESPECIALLY*** before changes are pushed. 

This will save precious time that we constantly waste fixing things in 
the chem package that used to work correctly. Please update these dirs 
and subdirs with files and correct outputs for cases that you use. It 
is imperative that everyone uses this because we often work on such
different areas of the chem package that we do not realize we break
features that others are dependent on.

For a template on how to view setting up these tests, take a look at the
$TESTDIR/adf/freq directory. Here I have set up an output file named
'freq.out' to test the coordinate collection and the frequency displaying 
of this file. Other directories should also have this 'runtest.sh' script
created when populated. This way, we can make a script that lies in the 
$TESTDIR directory that will enter all subdirs and run those scripts.

Any questions, come see me. Being active with this will make our lives 
much easier in the long run.
