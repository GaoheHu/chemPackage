# chemPackage
Python package created to manipulate NWChem and ADF input and output files along with plain XYZ files

## Dependencies
As of now, the only dependency outside the normal realm of packages like numpy is *natsort*. This package can be found and installed through pip or conda

## Additional Notes
**This package is highly experimental. Even before my quick hacking from python2 to python3, I would have recommended anyone to verify the results that it gives are correct**
