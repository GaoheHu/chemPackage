# chemPackage
Python package created to manipulate NWChem input and output files

**This package is highly experimental. Even before my quick hacking from python2 to python3, I would have recommended anyone to verify the results that it gives are correct**

### A test suite is being worked on in order to validate the different pieces of the package and ensure that it stays correct as others add code to it.
