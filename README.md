# chemPackage
Python package created to manipulate NWChem and ADF input and output files along with plain XYZ files

## Dependencies
As of now, the only dependency outside the normal realm of packages like numpy is *natsort*. This package can be found and installed through pip or conda.

## Additional Notes
**This package is still experimental. There are files and routines that still do not have unit tests and have not been verified. If you use any functions that do not have a corresponding unit test, there is a high chance that the results may not be correct. If any issues are found, please open an issue and it will be addressed.**
